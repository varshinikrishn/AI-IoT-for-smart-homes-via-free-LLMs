Smart Home LLM Interpretation – JSON Output Analysis

This repository contains the dissertation report and supporting screenshots for a project investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret smart-home commands and convert them into JSON device-state updates. The study specifically evaluates ChatGPT and Vicuna, comparing their behaviour across a wide range of smart-home scenarios.

The screenshots in this repository visually document real examples of JSON responses generated by the models, while the dissertation provides a full academic analysis, methodology, and discussion of findings.

Project Overview

Smart homes rely increasingly on natural-language interfaces that translate user commands (e.g., “Turn on the kitchen lights”) into structured machine-readable formats. This project explores:

How LLMs interpret natural-language smart-home instructions

How reliably they translate those commands into JSON device-state updates

Differences between ChatGPT and Vicuna in consistency, accuracy, and style

Potential risks such as over-generation, hallucination, or incorrect device manipulation

The project does not include code execution but instead focuses on analysis of generated results.

What the Screenshots Show

The screenshots capture side-by-side or individual examples of both LLMs responding to smart-home tasks, including:

Turning lights on/off

Adjusting TVs, speakers, and media devices

Locking/unlocking doors

Updating multiple devices in a single command

Handling ambiguous or complex instructions

Each example reveals differences in:

JSON formatting

Completeness of device updates

Whether unchanged values were included

Verbosity vs precision

Adherence to instructions (e.g., update only modified fields)

Dissertation Report

The included RevisedReport.pdf contains:

Background and literature review

Methodology for evaluating LLM behaviour

JSON-based smart-home schema description

Comparative analysis of Vicuna vs ChatGPT

Discussion of accuracy, consistency, reliability, and safety

Screenshots and model output evaluations

Conclusions and future directions

This serves as the main academic deliverable for the project.

Key Findings (Summary)

ChatGPT tends to produce concise JSON with minimal necessary changes.

Vicuna often generates full JSON structures including unchanged devices.

Both models can correctly interpret straightforward commands.

Vicuna occasionally adds imaginative or unnecessary actions.

ChatGPT adhered more consistently to structured-output constraints.

Both models require guardrails to prevent unsafe smart-home operations.

Full results are available in the dissertation.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists as a visual and academic reference, not as an executable codebase.
It is intended for:

Researchers studying LLM behaviour

Students working on smart-home automation or AI interpretability

Developers evaluating model reliability for structured output tasks

Anyone exploring JSON-based conversational control systems
